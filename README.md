# House-Price-Prediction-Bahria-Town
This project focuses on predictive modeling to estimate the selling price of houses of the Bahria Town real estate development. It uses machine learning trained on property features like size, location, bedrooms, and amenities to accurately forecast market value. The goal is to deploy a model that provides instant price estimations.

## Prerequisites & Installation

This project is built using Python and relies on several standard data science libraries.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x** must be installed on your system.

### Virtual Environment Setup

We highly recommend setting up a virtual environment (like **venv** or **conda**) to manage the dependencies for this project, keeping them separate from your system's global Python packages.

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installation

1.  **Install Python Libraries:**
    You must install the necessary libraries, primarily sourced from the `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy` packages.

    ```bash
    # Install the core libraries used for data handling and modeling
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
